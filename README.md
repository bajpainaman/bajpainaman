I'm a Computer Science student at Drexel University and CTO at a stealth startup building on the Avalanche blockchain. Passionate about blockchain protocols, DeFi innovations, AI/ML integrations for crypto, and open-source development in Web3. My work focuses on scalable on-chain solutions, RWAs (Real World Assets), synthetic assets, and programmable private credit to enhance liquidity, determinism, and permissionless finance in DeFi.

Currently architecting decentralized liquidity protocols, oracle networks, and AI-driven blockchain analytics to push the boundaries of crypto infrastructure.

## Featured Projects
Here are some of my key open-source crypto projects:

- **[orbital](https://github.com/bajpainaman/orbital)**  
  The world's first production-ready N-dimensional hyperspherical AMM on a custom Avalanche subnet, based on Paradigm VC research. Consolidates 190+ tokens into 10 pools with 15-150Ã— capital efficiency via hypersphere invariants, tick-based liquidity, multi-hop routing, flash loans, TWAP oracles, and NFT positions. Deployed on ETO Testnet for scalable DeFi with O(n) complexity and gas optimizations.

- **[Avalytics](https://github.com/bajpainaman/Avalytics)**  
  AI-driven blockchain CRM platform for Avalanche ecosystem growth intelligence ("Palantir for Crypto"). Transforms on-chain data into actionable BD insights with AI wallet profiling (Llama 3.1), ML cohort clustering (K-Means, GMM), lead scoring, and auto-sync to Monday.com/Clay/Salesforce. Features query-to-lead pipelines, behavioral analysis, and anomaly detection for VCs, DeFi protocols, and security teams.

- **[delphic](https://github.com/bajpainaman/delphic)**  
  Revolutionary oracle protocol bridging Web2 APIs to Web3 with secure, verifiable data feeds. Supports custom API setups, TEE-protected keys, stake-based security, dispute resolution, and off-chain storage (IPFS/Arweave). Built for DeFi price feeds, gaming data, and enterprise verification on Base L2 for low fees and multi-node consensus.
